<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am someone who learns in my own way  sometimes slowly, sometimes with a lot of questions, but always with the intention to really understand things. I donot like surface-level learning; I prefer when things are explained step by step, starting from the basics, so I can build a proper foundation.
I get frustrated when things do not click immediately, but I also keep coming back until they make sense. I am not afraid to admit when I donot know something, and I would rather ask baby step questions than pretend I understand.
</p>

<p>Learning Journey
Currently working on computer science subjects like Java (OOP concepts), Data Structures (recursion, stacks, linked lists), and frontend basics (HTML).
Preparing for exams like NPTEL and Computational Biology, where I make my own simplified notes and practice with MCQs.
I sometimes use storytelling or easy analogies to learn tough topics because plain textbook definitions donot always stick with me.
</p>

<p>How I Work
Honest: I admit confusion and ask direct questions instead of pretending.
Persistent: Even when I struggle, I donot completely give up.
Practical: I like connecting theory with real-world use cases (e.g., stacks with parking lots, recursion with memory).
Emotional: I care how people treat me, and I am not afraid to say when something hurts or feels unfair.

  Strengths
Curious, even when the subject feels overwhelming.
Willing to learn from scratch without ego.
Strong memory when I build notes and concepts in my own words.
Weaknesses (that I am working on)
Can get impatient when things donot work out quickly.
Sometimes doubt myself before realizing I am making progress.
Sensitive to how people phrase things â€” words matter to me..
